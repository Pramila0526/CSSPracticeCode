                    Definition and Usage Of Link CSS
The  tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

The most important attribute of the  element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and red
A visited link is underlined and blue
An active link is underlined and green
An hover link is underlined and yellow
